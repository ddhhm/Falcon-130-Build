OBSERVATIONS FROM MAINDEN FLIGHT

First flight was at a soccer field.

It is way too fast for my skill level. It traversed the length of the soccer field in at least 3 or 4 seconds.

CONCERNS

* The 120 degree camera gives me tunnel vision
* The camera angle imposed by the 3D printed mount.

I was so disoriented that I have to cut the throttle to avoid flying away.

I will fix these things and try again.

DAMAGE

It is extremely durable.  I crashed many times, but ultimately the receiver LEDs were dark, and it would not respond to throttle input any more. I will fix this and try to see why it broke so easily.
