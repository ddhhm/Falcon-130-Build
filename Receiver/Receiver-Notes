The receiver is an FrSky XSR.

It has been De-pinned using these instructions:

Soldered (temporarily) to my Betaflight F3 board and bound to my transmitter:

(Note, all instructions are from Jc or "Project Blue Falcon" purely by accident.  I know he has recently passed,
and it is just a testiment to how much he will be missed.  The guy just knew what I was tryin to do before I even 
tried it.  It almost feels like we are on our own - no offense to other content creators of course.)

Next, I made sure there is enough room in my frame, below the 4in1 ESC to mount the XSR.  This should keep it well protected in crashes.
