Camera mount is a 3D print from HyphPV on Thingiverse.  I used the 'Print-a-thing' app, and chose the non-adjustable

Telemetry.  Note, the image, First-Video-System-Test-OK.jpg, is not exactly correct wiring.  For Telemetry, the video wire goes to the "Video In" on the betaflight F3 controller, and the "Video out" line continues the circuit to the VTX. This was shown in detail in another video from Project Blue Falcon.
